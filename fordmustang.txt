Item Detail : 
It has ice cold A/C heat works also brand new Ford motor sport King Cobra clutch less than 300 miles on it. Brand new brakes done less than 500 miles ago. new timing chain and water pump. Everything works as it should including ash tray door. I have new MSD cap&rotor and motorsport red plug wires which I was going to change but then could not bring my self to do it. Even the plug wires are original and date coded 1987 which is why I decided not to change them. Whatever parts I have for the car will go with the car when sold. Also car has original weather striping which does not leak that's how original it is. All vin tags are in place.
